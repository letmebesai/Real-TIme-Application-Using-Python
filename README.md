# Real-TIme-Application-Using-Python
This project aims to develop a predictive model for housing prices using linear regression techniques.
The dataset utilized for this analysis is a
comprehensive housing dataset, typically featuring various attributes that
influence property values, such as the number of rooms, location, and
other socioeconomic factors. This project is a practical application of
supervised learning where the model learns from labeled data (features
and target prices) and applies that knowledge to predict house prices for
unseen data.
Open to any suggestions and workforce.
